# Opinion-Spam-Detection

This is an assignment of University of Washing Tacoma TCSS535 Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Acquisition couse. (Dec 2021)

---------------

I downloaded the opinion spam detection dataset from https://myleott.com/op-spam.html. The dataset contains truthful and deceptive (spam) reviews for hotels.
The goal of this project is to build a classifier which determines whether a given review isspam or non-spam and analyze the accuracy of machine learning models.

So, I trained three models (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest), and he accuracies of these models were compared and analyzed.
